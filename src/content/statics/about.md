### Working

> I'm Esmaeil MIRZAEE. I'm a fullstack developer. I program in `Java` and `Rust`. Also, I make beauriful websites leveraging `Figma` for design concepts. Then, I convert the design page into a live web page by `HTML`, `CSS/SCSS`, `Java/Typescript` and React.

### Teaching

> Moreover, I recently have added some content into my [YouTube](youttube.com) channel to help people to use new technology and learn about different concepts of programming language.
